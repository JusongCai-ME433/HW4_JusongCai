# HW4_JusongCai

In this homework, I will build the MCP4912 DAC circuit and write a library to communicate with it. Files will include codes and compile folder, nScope output screenshots, and circuit drawing, as well as actual circuit board picture. Library is named as spi.c and spi.h, and main.c is the main program in the HW4.X folder.
